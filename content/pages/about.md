I studied Computer Science at California State University, Monterey Bay and now at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) in San Francisco.

Previously interned at the [Museum of Natural History](https://www.pgmuseum.org/), [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](https://www.mbari.org/) and [Bechtel corp](https://www.bechtel.com/).


A few of my more well-known projects include:

- [**How to get a job in tech**](/series/how-to-get-a-job-in-tech) [[Subreddit]() [Hacker News]()] a 4 post series of my most popular blog where I provide a guide on how to get a job in tech.

- [**Monterey county climate visualization**](https://gautamtata.github.io/watershed-guardians/), A project I worked on with the Museum of Natural History in Monterey, CA to visualize the long-term effects of climate change on the local watershed and ecosystem. Tech Stack: React, Mapbox and Python.
