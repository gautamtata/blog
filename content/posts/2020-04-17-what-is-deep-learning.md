## Before we get started: The difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

No, these terms cannot be used interchangeably as they are often done in today's media. 

### Artificial Intelligence 

You can think of AI as the Umbrella that -- encapsulates the effort to automate tasks which would usually be done by Human beings and that includes the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning answers one question: Can a computer go beyond what was asked of it to perform? Can the computer "learn" on it's own and and answer questions? This is a different approach: Instead of explicitly programming  the computer to do a task, can we **train** the computer to do some tasks on it's own?

In our old paradigm, the structure used to be: Rules + Data --> Answers

The Machine Learning paradigm, the structure is: Data + Answers --> Rules

A ML algorithm transforms its input data to spit out some meaningful output, a process that is **learned** from exposure to different kinds of expected answers. Ex: To build an algorithm that predicts numbers, the algorithms first needs to learn what numbers are how they look like.

Imagine a graph of X and Y coordinates where X is grades and Y is test-scores. The students who get into college are the ones who have atleast half the max score of X and half the max score of Y. Here, **Learning** is defined as a systematic search for different possible coordinate changes and using feedback, the number of points being correctly classified as a rating of how well the algorithm is doing. Learning is an automatic search to find better slopes that classify our data correctly.

### Deep Learning

So, what is Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a sub-field of Machine Learning. It is a new way of learning representations of data that puts more weight on having multiple layers of **More Meaningful** representation. The deep in Deep Learning just refers to the number of layers that are used to achieve better representations of data points.

In Deep Learning, the layered representations are mimiced versions of nature called : **Neural Networks**. As fancy as that term sounds, Neural Networks are extremely simple and we will learn more about them in the next chapter. But something to remember for now, Neural Network are meant to be (from a neurobiological perspective) a version of **Neurons** in our brain. These Neurons in a simplified version, take in a single input and spit out a single input. Multiple connections of these neurons are called a Neural Network.
