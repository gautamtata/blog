## Introduction
This is a follow-up article which demonstrates the **RIGHT** way to apply for jobs.

**NOTE: Some of these methods might be socially unacceptable and therefore you should do what YOU feel is right.**

Now that you have that awesome resume, let's talk about what are the different ways you can apply for jobs.

In this article, I'm going to start with my statistics for how many jobs I applied to, how many interviews I got and the means I used to get those interviews.

Next we will move onto what methods we can use to apply to jobs.

## Table of Contents

1. My Statistics of Job Applications
2. Employee referrals
3. The art of cold emailing.
4. Walking into companies.
5. Career Fairs.

## My Job Application Statistics

(NOTE: I WILL ALSO SHARE MY FINAL SPREADSHEET OF COMPANIES TODO)

(NOTE 2: THESE ARE STATISTICS OVER 8 MONTHS: FROM JULY TO FEBRUARY CORRESPONDING TO THE TIME AFTER I GRADUATED TILL THE TIME I GOT EMPLOYED)

> **JOBS APPLIED** -> 270

> **ACCEPTED FOR INTERVIEW** -> 51

> **NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM ONLINE APPLICATIONS** -> 8

> **NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM COLD EMAILS** -> 16

> **NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM EMPLOYEE REFERRALS** -> 4

> **NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM WALKING INTO COMPANIES** -> 21

> **NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM CAREER FAIRS** -> 2

As you can see, an incredible percentage **(~72%)** of my interviews were from cold-emails or from walking into companies. Only a disappointing **15%** interviews were from online applications.

Overall, I converted my application into interviews approximately **1/4 times** so, 1 interview for every 4 rejected.

An important thing to note: All of these interviews are over a period of time. There are many variables affecting these numbers: Continuous iteration of my resume over a period of time, peaks and valleys in hiring etc.

But the overwhelming statistic here is that Cold-emailing and walking into companies got me my interviews.


# The Methods to Apply for Jobs

## Employee Referral
This is by far the easiest way to get your resume directly read by a recruiter or even an engineering manager!

The referral almost guarantees that your resume will atleast be read by a human. So if you can get one of those valuable referral go get em!

### Tips for getting employee referrals

Squeeze your networks (Extremely shamelessly - Cannot say this enough): For many people, reaching out to your friends, alumni, professors, classmates for referrals might be embarrasing. Trust me it was for me!. 

But the other point to think here is that it is YOUR JOB/A CAREER YOU ARE INTERESTED IN! The reality is that most people are always ready to help. The other reason they will help you is that Valley Companies often give very high referral bonuses if you get hired (5-10k!) so people are usually incentivized to give you a referral. The other thing to remember is that this is not a huge hassle. It usually takes <2 mins and 1 click of a button.

Below I have attached samples of 2 emails that I used to ask for referrals. 1 is with a classmate who works at Atallasian and the other is with my professor who has tons of contacts in the valley. For my professor, I just browsed his LinkedIn contacts made a spreadsheet of people I would like an introduction to. For some he did for most he didn't. I got an interview at VISA and Apple this way.

Hey Person I know from School,
I hope you're doing well. I think we may have crossed paths in one of our classes.

I saw on LinkedIn that you're working at Atlassian. Congrats! Hope the job's been treating you well.

I'd greatly appreciate a chance to chat about how to effectively approach applying to companies. I've already applied quite a few companies, but haven't heard back.

Do you have 20 mins sometime next week, say Tuesday, June 25th, at 10am for a phone call? 

A bit more about me:
--------------------------
I'm a full-stack engineer that just graduated from CSU Monterey Bay (California) with a degree in Computer Science. I've built and shipped products that have users. I obsess over user experience and I do whatever it takes to deliver reliable, useful software.

Out of my projects, I’m most proud of the work that I’ve done for the Pacific Grove museum, to help researchers …

Once again, would greatly appreciate any help / advice you may have. I look forward hearing back.

Hi Professor who I know has a ton of contacts,

Hope you've been well. Thanks for a great capstone and an amazing senior year!

I'd greatly, greatly appreciate your help in the following ways, if possible:

1. Could you introduce me to people you know at Tech companies in the United States so that I can demonstrate to them what I can bring to their teams? I've already compiled this sheet, in which I listed all of your contacts that I found on LinkedIn, who I'd like to connect with. For each person you are willing to introduce me to, I will draft up a tailored email targeted to that person, in which I share a summary of the work that I've done, and ask them for a chance to chat about open roles and for a chance to demonstrate what I can bring to their teams. Then, you can simply forward that email asking if they're OK with a connection, and if yes, you can just CC me on that email thread. 

2. Could you please provide feedback on the blurb I've included below? This is the main piece in my outreach to companies. I've tried to make it as clear as possible what I can do. Unfortunately I haven't had much luck applying to companies online or directly reaching out to engineering managers / recruiters at companies. Would appreciate any advice you may have.

Out of my projects, I’m most proud of the web application I built for the Pacific Grove museum, to help researchers effectively communicate the effects of climate change on the local water ecosystem - to the local community. This application was built in React, and has had hundreds of visitors so far.

I know I'm asking for a lot. I want to minimize the effort needed on your end to help me out, so please let me know if there's anything else I can do to make this easier for you. I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you.

## The End

That's it! In this post, we completed a walkthrough of Recurrent Neural Networks, including what they are, how they work, why they're useful, how to train them, and how to implement one. There's still much more you can do, though:

- Learn about [Long short-term memory](http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/lstm-how-to-train-neural-networks-to-write-like-lovecraft/) networks, a more powerful and popular RNN architecture, or about [Gated Recurrent Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) (GRUs), a well-known variation of the LSTM.
- Experiment with bigger / better RNNs using proper ML libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Read about [Bidirectional RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks), which process sequences both forwards and backwards so more information is available to the output layer.
- Try out [Word Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) like [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec), which can be used to turn words into more useful vector representations.
- Check out the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK), a popular Python library for working with human language data.

I write a lot about [Machine Learning](/tag/machine-learning/), so [subscribe to my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=intro-to-rnns) if you're interested in getting future ML content from me.

Thanks for reading!
