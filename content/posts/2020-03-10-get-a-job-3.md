# Introduction and Background

Have you ever failed a tech interview? I have failed a ton of interviews from behavioral, phone-screens and onsite whiteboarding questions. I can remember them to be embarrasing situations that I have faced but it's also something that I learned a lot from.

I realized that I didn't have a set schedule and didn't put in enough prep time and thought that coding experience in previous internships would help me crack these interviews. Well, coding interviews are a different beast. The test for algorithmic puzzles is very different from coding in real life and therefore, one needs to prepare accordingly.

Interviewers want to work with candidates they like. Leaving a good impression greatly improve your chances of success.

> Tell me about yourself. How did you get into coding? Why was X(job specific) a good fit for you? How do your goals align with X companies?

## The elevator pitch
An elevator pitch is exactly what it sounds. Imagine you are stuck in an elavator with someone who you want to sell yourself to. You have about 30 seconds to a minute to get your point across.

* Keep it short
* Get straight to the point
* Grab their attention

For example, for internships you can mention your name, school, area of focus and past internships/noteworthy projects. For full-time positions, you should mention past-companies, note-worthy projects etc.

> My name is Gautam and I'm currently a student at CSU Monterey Bay. I have previously interned at the Museum of Natural History where I developed a application that visualizes climate change in Monterey county which is used by over 50 researchers. 
>
> I became really interested in the mapping space because I loved the power of spreading a message across using a Map. Since then I have been working at learning X tools and researching X possibilities which is when I came across Uber maps. I'd be greatful to speak with you about X opportunity. 

With an interviewer, you must always ask the question: Why do they want me? Align yourself with the values of the company, understand what tech-stack they use, read their engineering blog and impress the interviewer.


## Assumptions

The first assumption is that you know how to code. You know a language that you are familiar with and (hopefully) know the in's and out's.

This article covers a general tech-interview blueprint: Behavioral interviews and technical interviews. It **does not** cover specific area questions like web development, embedded systems etc.

## Time to prepare

Assume that to cover preperation end to end you will need a full month of dedication spending 2-3 hours a day prepping. You can increase or decrease that based on your experience.
