## WHY?

The demand for fish as a source of meat increases by an average of 6% each year--making it the most rapidly growing food in the meat industry. This demand has doubled since the start of the 2000s and will double again by 2050 if the current growth rate holds.

Fish-farming has been expanding to meet this demand by increasing the number of fish within their facilities. However, as the fish become more closely packed: their quality of life decreases.

Maintaining a high quality-of-life requires the following needs to be met:

 - A low rate of sea-lice (Lepeiopthteirus Salmonis) infestation
 - low levels of the stress hormone Cortisol
 - The ideal level of food (and timed food delivery) 
 - An appropriate biomass size
 - Well maintained mesh nets that keep the fish enclosed (and predators out)
 - A careful water quality balance 
 - low rates of disease

Unfortunately, quality-of-life decreases exponentially as fish become more tightly packed due to the relationship between these factors and space (less space = more transference of sea-lice, disease, etc.)

## WHAT CAN WE DO/FOCUS ON TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY OF LIFE?

- examples of awesome figures such as the 86% increase in whatever

- Feeding costs 60% of fisheries revenue. Unreasonable feeding can be big factor in revenue [de Verdal et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/raq.12202)
- Manually selecting features is a laborious, heuristic approach, and the effectis highly dependent on both luck and experience (Mohanty et al., 2016)
- DL models have shown strong stability under challenging conditions such as low light and high noise, and they perform better than do traditional artificial feature extraction methods (Sun et al., 2018)

## HOW DO WE DO EXECUTE?

Most fish farms have little, if any, technological support and tight budgets. Therefore, any solution must be easy to install and low cost.

Our Deep Learning solution requires only one piece of equipment--a camera with measurement instruments integrated into it. One well place instrument in the center of a fish farm can collect and aggregate all of the data required to monitor the seven quality-of-life metrics mentioned above. When combined, these metrics can also produce a single overall health value of the fish farm which represents a holistic at-a-glance health rating.

Using the aforementioned single set of aggregated data and computer vision, the following Deep Learning applications can be developed:
- Sea-Lice Detection
- Behavioral Analysis of Fish
- Dynamic Fish Appetite Estimation and Delivery 
- Biomass Measurement
- Mesh Integrity Monitoring
- Water Quality Monitoring and Control
- Disease Identification and Prevention

## WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS
Let's briefly breakdown everything so far before we jump into the applications:

  1. we can utilize aggregated data from a single piece of equipment in seven different applications--each dedicated to a critical factor in fish quality-of-life
  2. each application uses similar Deep Learning technologies but results in a unique reporting value that fish farmers can take action on
  3. the outputs can be combined in one final Deep Learning application which represents the overall health of the farm

Now imagine these seven metrics, related measurements, and overall health evaluation being displayed in real-time via a gorgeous dashboard! ðŸš€


# The APPLICATIONS


### Sea-Lice Detection

![Sea lice of Salmon](./media-link/deeplearning/fishLice.jpg)
##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES

Fish farms worldwide suffer from infestations of sea-lice. These parasites attach themselves to a fish host and feed off their skin/blood. The denser the fish farm--the easier it becomes for sea-lice to spread. 

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM

Harsh chemical treatments have become the most common method of sea-lice removal. While effective at removing sea-lice, the chemical treatment has adverse effects on the fish (**such as what**). It also prevents the Salmon from being sold for several weeks while they detox. 

A deep learning solution utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision to detect/identify sea-lice before they spread over to the other fish enable farmers to take actions such as (**what, moving fish populations or temporarily reducing density?**) before critical population levels of sea-lice trigger a complete chemical flush. 

##### relation to final overall health metric (**The sea-lice detection application plays a critical role in determining...**) ?


### Behavioral Analysis of Fish
![Fish Behavior analysis](./media-link/deeplearning/fish-swimming.gif)

##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Small environment changes can rapidly increase stress levels for fish, thereby increasing quantities of the stress hormone Cortisol inside them. Cortisol alters the taste of the fish and has negative ramifications (**such as what**) for the consumer.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
The IdTracker.ai model leverages two different CNNs to provide the capability for tracking all individual fish behaviors in small and large groups--allowing farmers to detect behavior anomalies associated with increased Cortisol. However, the challenge remains enormous since tracking individual fish behaviors involves non-rigid deformations, low image quality, and frequent occlusions.

{x} has demonstrated another solution that utilizes `modified motion influence maps` and `Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)` to systematically detect, localize, and recognize unusual behaviors within a fish school.

### Fish Appetite detection


##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
No metric has a stronger correlation to production efficiency and breeding cost than fish feeding. Feeding accounts for 60% of the average fish farm's operations budget.

Insufficient feeding drastically lowers the fish breeding/biomass growth rates while overfeeding results in wasted costs and pollution of the surrounding water environment.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
Nailing the optimal feeding times and delivery size can be challenging. Traditionally, farmers use simple timers and intuitive experience to make their decisions--which does not take into account important environmental and nutritional factors.

Aggregated data containing visual information, water measurements, and historical data on fish responses to past feedings can be combined with 3D-CNN and RNN models geared for temporal/spatial data flow to generate drastically more efficient feeding. Maloy et a. utilized this dual-network approach to choose optimal feeding times that accounted for both feeding and non-feeding behaviors.

### Biomass Estimation

##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Estimating biomass forms the basis for sustainably managing a fish-farm as provides farmers an insight into the quantity, size, and weight of the current fish. These crucial data points also drive decision making related to feeding and behavioral management.

Measuring biomass can be challenging without human intervention as the fish move freely in an environment where lighting and visibility conditions can not be controlled. Depending on the depth of the fish, different degrees of occlusion and light change need to be accounted for.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
Two possible solutions can come together to accurately estimate biomass:

  1. Train a Deep Learning algorithm to understand the mapping between sonar and optical images
  2. Segment images of individual fish, track them over time, and continuously estimate volume and weight through changes in the fish using the depth of the object within the frame.

### Mesh Integrity Detection

![Mesh Detection - courtesy of ](./media-link/deeplearning/ mesh-detection.png)

##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Specially designed mesh nets fence the farmed fish into a confined area and ensure their safety/health. Farmed fish escaping the farm would be disastrous for the farm as well as the nearby ecosystem.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
Currently, divers perform a "net integrity check" in which they SCUBA around the perimeter of the farm and check nodes in the netting for signs of wear. Hiring professional divers, or owning the equipment to perform the dives, can be an arduous/expensive process.

A deep learning neural network trained to recognize nodes in the netting can easily create rules for placement and monitoring of the mesh nets.

### Predicting Water Quality

##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
High levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and other natural elements lead to lower stress and disease levels, as well as increased levels of breeding. Quality monitoring requires accurate measurements of parameters related to elements in the water over a long period.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
 Deep learning has achieved great results in both short and long-term water quality monitoring using attention-equipped Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and RNNs to capture/predict time-sequence information related to water elements.

### Fish Fillets Defect Detection 

![Pellets of aquaculture feeding](./media-link/deeplearning/pellets.jpeg)

**[REWRITE IF NEEDED]**

##### PROBLEM IT SOLVES
The detection, recognition and localization of food defects have proven to be extremely challenging infood manufacture. For fish fillets, blood spots are detrimental to their quality and reduce their marketvalue. The manual classification method hasnâ€™t met the needs of modern industry. The modern industryr equires a robust, rapid, effective, automated, non-invasive and low-cost method for the classification of normal and defective fish fillets.

##### HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM
Misimi et al.  used pre-trained CNN and SVM models for accuratesegmentation and localization of blood spots and the classification of defective cod fish fillets. A noveldata augmentation method was proposed in this study that desensitized the CNN for shape and focusedonly on color features for the classification between normal and defective fish fillets. The 3D informationwas used to localize the blood spots and calculate the relevant gripper vectors, as an input to robotic processing.
