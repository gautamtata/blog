Let's get something straight. A lot of people in the valley are really smart and just **name-drop** in their resumes. But what if you're like me? What if you went to a no-name school with no Big-N internships but you want to work in Big Tech?

The resume is what lands you those interviews. So, let's talk about what you can improve in your resume in order to make it **more visible and attractive** to recruiters.

## Table of Contents
1. Beating the Applicant tracking system(ATS)
2. Getting past the 6-second recruiter screen.
3. Getting past the engineering manager.

## Example
I'm going to give you an example of numbers on how your resume gets to the engineering manager.

On average, a Salesforce software engineering position gets about **~3000 applicants.(Online applications)** Now that's a huge number. 

1. But what most applicants don't realize is that 75% of those resumes are automatically rejected by something called ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and this is taking the lower bound of percentages.
2. Congratulations! Now you are one of the 750 people whose resume has made it to a human. The recruiter. Now it's time for the infamous **six-second-resume-scan**. The recruiter on average will spend about 6-10 seconds on a resume scanning for keywords and will further narrow the applicant trail down to 100-150 applicants. That's another 20% decrease in applicants.
3. These 100-150 applicants are given some kind of coding challenge/behavioral interview which lessens the applicants down to 50.
4. The next step would be another screen which could be technical/behavioral which should reduce the candidate pool to 10-15.
5. The engineering manager then decides if you should be called onsite. If you have come onsite, there are about 5-7 more interviews before you get the offer.

**Nervous? You shouldn't be.** The Bay Area is known for it's competitive hiring and companies use the strategy of rejecting talented people if that means avoiding **hiring false positives.**

There is a lot of **randomeness** in the process. The recruiter might be busy or just about to go on lunch and might throw away your resume. The ATS might incorrectly read some experience that you thought will come up etc.

We just want to do our best in order to minimize the randomeness. 
## Without further ado, here are the following Tips to make your resume stand out: 

## 1. ATS Scanner
This here is the big one. Most (if not all) tech companies in the valley use an ATS scanner in-order to parse applicants resumes.


Long story short, An Applicant Tracking System or ATS for short - is a software that is used by recruiters/recruiting agencies to collect, sort, parse and rank perspective job-seekers according to open positions. You might be asking why companies use this and/or this might seem unfair. Well, the honest truth is that Fortune 500 companies receive way too many applicants to be sorted by humans. This would clog up the pipeline and make hiring slower. 

So whether we like it or not, the ATS is here to stay.


### a. Basics of how ATS works
The ATS parses a resume's content into categories and then scans those categories for specific keywords which have been predetermined and then ranks the resume. If there was **x%** match then the resume is passed on to the recruiter.

So this only means that the ATS is designed to weed out the **least-qualified** applicants as opposed to identify which candidates are the best.

This as you may have guessed also weeds out the best candidates who don't have the **right words** in their resume. If this is one of you and you have received tons of rejections it's not your fault.

### b. Beating ATS

**So here is where resumes go wrong. (stats accoriding to TopResume)**
1. 25% of applicants have buried contact information in the header.
2. 43% of applicants are submitted with an incompatible file type.
3. 21% of applicants use graphics or charts which are unparsable.
4. People use fancy templates that are also unparsable.

Contrary to popular belief, PDF is not the most ATS-friendly file type. While PDF's do a phenomenal job at presevering design,style and format of your resume not all ATS fully support PDF's. So, unless the file type listed is pdf stick to using **.doc or .docx**. Amazingly, **.txt** file types are the best for ATS parsing but limit your options for style and design.

### b.2 Optimize with the right keywords
One of the best ways to beat ATS is to use the right words in your resume. A lot of times, you might think that using words like "attention to detail" 

## Now What?

You made it! A quick recap of what we did:

- Introduced **neurons**, the building blocks of neural networks.
- Used the **sigmoid activation function** in our neurons.
- Saw that neural networks are just neurons connected together.
- Created a dataset with Weight and Height as inputs (or **features**) and Gender as the output (or **label**).
- Learned about **loss functions** and the **mean squared error** (MSE) loss.
- Realized that training a network is just minimizing its loss.
- Used **backpropagation** to calculate partial derivatives.
- Used **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) to train our network.

There's still much more to do:

- Experiment with bigger / better neural networks using proper machine learning libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- [Build your first neural network with Keras](/blog/keras-neural-network-tutorial/).
- Tinker with [a neural network in your browser](https://playground.tensorflow.org).
- Discover [other activation functions](https://keras.io/activations/) besides sigmoid, like [Softmax](/blog/softmax/).
- Discover [other optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) besides SGD.
- Read my [introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) (CNNs). CNNs revolutionized the field of [Computer Vision](/tag/computer-vision/) and can be extremely powerful.
- Read my [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) (RNNs), which are often used for [Natural Language Processing](/tag/natural-language-processing/) (NLP).
