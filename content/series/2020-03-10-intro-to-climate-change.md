Let us talk about what climate change is and what the differences between global warming and climate change are.

Climate change and global warming are used almost interchangeably by the media which often causes more confusion and panic as opposed to providing legitimate information.

To first understand the difference between global warming and climate change, we must first understand the difference between weather and climate.

**Weather**: Weather is a phenomenon that changes rapidly and occurs locally over short periods.

>  If you don't like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes. - Mark Twain

**Climate**: Climate is long term patterns of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over years and decades. [nasa.gov](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/)

## Global Warming
Global warming is the long-term hearing of Earth's climate system. The primary causes of global warming are fossil-fuel burning which traps greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere.

Since the pre-industrial period, human-activities are estimated to have increased Earth's global average temperature by about 1-degree Celcius. [nasa.gov](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/)

## Climate Change
Climate Change is a long term change in the average weather patterns that have to define Earth's local and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects. The climate can/has been changed in two ways: Human activities such as foolish fuel burning or natural processes such as cyclical ocean patterns like Hurrican Katrina or El Nino. It could also be caused by other natural processes such as volcanic activity [Krakatoa](Krakatoa explosion).

Scientists use observations from the ground, air, space and theoretical models[theoretical](models) from **historical data** to monitor and study climate change.

This data is a key indicator of the following: Ocean temperature increase;rising sea levels; Glaciers melting; Hurricanes etc.


## The Series

Now that we have an understanding of the key differences between Climate change and global warming, Let's get started with our first part in our series: The evidence for why climate change is **REAL.**
